Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in network traffic data using machine learning techniques. It implements two primary models: Isolation Forest and Autoencoder, to identify anomalous behavior in the data.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to detect anomalous network traffic that could indicate malicious activity or system issues. The project uses two different anomaly detection methods:

Isolation Forest: A tree-based ensemble method designed for anomaly detection.
Autoencoder: A type of neural network used to learn efficient representations of data, which can be used to detect anomalies based on reconstruction errors.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of network traffic data. Each row in the dataset represents a network event with various features.

Features: Numerical representations of different aspects of network traffic.
Labels: Indicate the type of network event. For this project, we are interested in identifying the anomalies (unusual events).
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file should include:

plaintext
Copy code
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
keras
tensorflow
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/anomaly-detection-network-traffic.git
cd anomaly-detection-network-traffic
Prepare the Data:
Place your dataset in the data directory and ensure it is named appropriately.

Run the Anomaly Detection Script:

bash
Copy code
python anomaly_detection.py
This script performs the following steps:

Loads and preprocesses the data.
Trains the Isolation Forest and Autoencoder models.
Evaluates the models and generates classification reports and confusion matrices.
Results
The results of the anomaly detection models are displayed as classification reports and confusion matrices for both training and testing datasets.
